Needs more troubleshooting**\n\n**Update: Registrations re-opened** We encountered a bug where people could not log in, see https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/3422#issuecomment-1616112264 . As a workaround we opened registrations. \n\n## Thanks\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the Lemmy.world team and the 2 admins of other servers [@stanford@discuss.as200950.com](https://discuss.as200950.com/u/stanford) and [@sunaurus@lemm.ee](https://lemm.ee/u/sunaurus) for their help! We did some thorough troubleshooting to get this working! \n\n## The upgrade\n\nThe upgrade itself isn't too hard. Create a backup, and then change the image names in the `docker-compose.yml` and restart.\n\nBut, like the first 2 tries, after a few minutes the site started getting slow until it stopped responding. Then the troubleshooting started.\n\n## The solutions\nWhat I had noticed previously, is that the lemmy container could reach around 1500% CPU usage, above that the site got slow. Which is weird, because the server has 64 threads, so 6400% should be the max.\nSo we tried what [@sunaurus@lemm.ee](https://lemm.ee/u/sunaurus) had suggested before: we created extra lemmy containers to spread the load. (And extra lemmy-ui containers). And used nginx to load balance between them.\n\nEt voilà. That seems to work.\n\nAlso, as suggested by him, we start the lemmy containers with the scheduler disabled, and have 1 extra lemmy running with the scheduler enabled, unused for other stuff.\n\nThere will be room for improvement, and probably new bugs, but we're very happy lemmy.world is now at 0.18.1-rc. This fixes a lot of bugs.\n\n",

Needs more troubleshooting**\n\n**Update: Registrations re-opened** We encountered a bug where people could not log in, see https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/3422#issuecomment-1616112264 . As a workaround we opened registrations. \n\n## Thanks\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the Lemmy.world team and the 2 admins of other servers [@stanford@discuss.as200950.com](https://discuss.as200950.com/u/stanford) and [@sunaurus@lemm.ee](https://lemm.ee/u/sunaurus) for their help! We did some thorough troubleshooting to get this working! \n\n## The upgrade\n\nThe upgrade itself isn't too hard. Create a backup, and then change the image names in the `docker-compose.yml` and restart.\n\nBut, like the first 2 tries, after a few minutes the site started getting slow until it stopped responding. Then the troubleshooting started.\n\n## The solutions\nWhat I had noticed previously, is that the lemmy container could reach around 1500% CPU usage, above that the site got slow. Which is weird, because the server has 64 threads, so 6400% should be the max.\nSo we tried what [@sunaurus@lemm.ee](https://lemm.ee/u/sunaurus) had suggested before: we created extra lemmy containers to spread the load. (And extra lemmy-ui containers). And used nginx to load balance between them.\n\nEt voilà. That seems to work.\n\nAlso, as suggested by him, we start the lemmy containers with the scheduler disabled, and have 1 extra lemmy running with the scheduler enabled, unused for other stuff.\n\nThere will be room for improvement, and probably new bugs, but we're very happy lemmy.world is now at 0.18.1-rc. This fixes a lot of bugs.\n\n",

As a workaround we opened registrations. \n\n## Thanks\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the Lemmy.world team and the 2 admins of other servers [@stanford@discuss.as200950.com](https://discuss.as200950.com/u/stanford) and [@sunaurus@lemm.ee](https://lemm.ee/u/sunaurus) for their help! We did some thorough troubleshooting to get this working! \n\n## The upgrade\n\nThe upgrade itself isn't too hard. Create a backup, and then change the image names in the `docker-compose.yml` and restart.\n\nBut, like the first 2 tries, after a few minutes the site started getting slow until it stopped responding. Then the troubleshooting started.\n\n## The solutions\nWhat I had noticed previously, is that the lemmy container could reach around 1500% CPU usage, above that the site got slow. Which is weird, because the server has 64 threads, so 6400% should be the max.\nSo we tried what [@sunaurus@lemm.ee](https://lemm.ee/u/sunaurus) had suggested before: we created extra lemmy containers to spread the load. (And extra lemmy-ui containers). And used nginx to load balance between them.\n\nEt voilà. That seems to work.\n\nAlso, as suggested by him, we start the lemmy containers with the scheduler disabled, and have 1 extra lemmy running with the scheduler enabled, unused for other stuff.\n\nThere will be room for improvement, and probably new bugs, but we're very happy lemmy.world is now at 0.18.1-rc. This fixes a lot of bugs.\n\n",
